"# USAccidentsProject" 

In this project, we analyzed and estimated the severity of road accidents using historical U.S. accident data from Kaggle. We began by preprocessing the data and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends. After that, we trained multiple machine learning models to predict accident severity. The best-performing model was selected, and we developed a small application that could predict the severity of an accident based on input data.
